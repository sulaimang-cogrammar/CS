* Three things that should have alerted me:
1. The bank asking me to open a zip file.
2. Typing error in the email address ("fruad_servces"@bank.com)
3. The generic domain ("bank".com)
4. The bank requiring me to fill in a form to freeze my account.
5. "URGENT - complete forms": The subject has nothing to do with the content of the email.

* The computer may be infected by a variant of a human-activated worm.

* Social Engineering is a type of hacking that involves getting close to victims
through communication (either directly or electronically), and may
be carried out over a short period, or over a number of years. The aim of social
engineering is to get a victim to to trust you, so that they may share valuable
information, data, or money. Phishing is a variant of social engineering that involves
sending unsolicited communication to several potential victims to increase the chances
of getting a "bite" (a response from a victim). Once a target is obtained, the 
phisher will attempt to obtain what they want through psychological manipulation.
Social engineering may also involve providing victims with software to be installed
intentionally or unintentionally by the victim, which then causes unexpected behaviour
or may exfiltrate important information from the victim's device and may possibly also
damage the device irreparably. Software that is developed to perform such malicious acts
is called "malware" (derived from the words malfunction and software). To avoid having a device
be infected with malware, victims should install a reliable antivirus. They should ensure
that they do not install potentially unwanted applications on their devices, and ensure they
are always aware of the source of the software they install on their computers. If downloading
from reputable websites, they may also receive a checksum for the files they download,
which they can then use to check that the files they download match the files provided by those
reputable websites.
