* If passwords are being reused in different accounts, then
then the combination of email address and password may
allow them to get into those other accounts as well.

* To prevent this, given a data breach, victims
  can change the passwords in affected and unaffected accounts.
* They should also consider using different passwords
  for different accounts to prevent future issues.
