# Security Framework

## The issue

There are several weak points in the current system that are likely to invite
security breaches. One of the main issues is that staff members use personal
computers att the office - if these belong to the staff members, then that is
a weak point because the company does not have full control over those devices.

A greater issue, then, is that some staff members do their work in coffee shops
or cafes, which means that the network they are using is possibly insecure.

There is also no on-site IT technician, which means that devices are likely not
being updated or patched regularly, and staff may also not have the insight to
identify issues.

## Policies

Staff doing work remotely must use a VPN to connect to the company network,
and staff working in-office may not bring their own storage devices to work.
When possible,, the company should issue staff with company-owned devices and
all devices that access company data must have a firewall and antivirus installed.
The company must also get a VPN and all staff must use it when working remotely.
Staff may not - under any circumstance - leave their devices unattended in public,
and devices must be locked when not in use. 

The company must manage data access based on roles. The company should employ
an IT technician to manage devices, and a security administrator must be employed
from management to oversee security policies and compliance.

## Awareness

To ensure all staff remain aware of security policies, the company must hold
frequent training sessions and conduct phishing tests periodically.
